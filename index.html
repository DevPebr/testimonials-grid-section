        ‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a 
        transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
        for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
        The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
        the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù</p>

  <h1> Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and 
    learning from their experiences was easy.</h1>

    <p style="margin-top: 20px; color: white; opacity:70%;"> ‚Äú The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program 
      gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable 
      junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from 
      an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ‚Äù</p>

  <h1>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h1>

  <p style="margin-top: 20px; color: hsl(219, 29%, 14%); opacity: 70%; line-height: 22px; letter-spacing: 0.3px;">
     ‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
    professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
    student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
    did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
    project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
    could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
    experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
    100% recommend! ‚Äù</p>
